MAGMA implementation
====================
After implementing the Schreier-Sims-Minkwitz algorithm in Coq, I implemented it
in the Computer Algebra System MAGMA (this was required for a course). It is
supposed to give the exact same results as the Coq implementation, although I
did not test it extensively.
